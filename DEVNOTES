To disable stack checker run 
	make <target> STACK_CHECK=0


1. all strings representing variable names are duplicated, the duplicate is used
   and is thus the responibilty of the interpreter to free.

2. Should we make common functions like sin, cos, tan, sqrt, asin, acos, atan,
   atan2, pow, log, sign floor, ceil, min/max, rand, etc. instructions for speed
   since if these are used a lot the overhead of the CALL bytecode is going to 
   be very significant, espcialy since none of these take more than 2 args, and
   do not take arrays, so they will probably signifcantly faster if they have
   their own bytecode. (for example rand(), probably takes about 3 times as long
   to call as run... same with floor/ceil/sign)
   
	1 arg float   sin,cos,tan,sqrt,asin,acos,atan,ln,floor,ceil,rand
	2 arg float   atan2, pow, min, max
