TODO: In no particular order.
general
 1. Fix Makefile (.d's seem to be somewhat screwy, and test get's made always...)
     Note there may not be a way to make this stop, it's just make generating errors
     when the autogenerated dependancies are not present...
 2. Fix makefile 2: When compsl.y has a serious error make clean fails to build it ?!
 3. Makefile doesn't rebuild something it should when compsl.y is changed
