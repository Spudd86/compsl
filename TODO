TODO: In no particular order.
general
 1. Fix Makefile (.d's seem to be somewhat screwy, and test get's made always...)
     Note there may not be a way to make this stop, it's just make generating errors
     when the autogenerated dependancies are not present...
 2. When bytecode is changed make clean is neccessary or compile errors will happen
 
interpreter
 1. add conditional compilation to headers for C++ compiling
 2. finsh bytecodes
 3. figure out how to make eclipse build our test case - DONE!
 4. finish API
 5. add test cases for entire API
 6. add test cases for all instructions
 7. Figure out some way to allow interpreter to be terminated if it goes into an
    infinite loop.
 8. figure out how to make debug hooks
 9.
